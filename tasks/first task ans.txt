total 3 machines
-- first machine is bastion --- launch linux machine --- security group is: ssh-22-anywhere
-- second and third machine --- launch 2 linux machines -- security group is: http-80-anywhere, ssh-22-custom-<firstmachinesgid>

now install apahce in both second and third machines and check in the browser whether apache is running or not
after that, create alb with the second and thrid machines. give the security group for alb is http-80-anywhere.
if the health check is not healthy then put the second and third machines security group as: http-80-albsg-custom, ssh-22-custom-<firstmachinesgid>
now check in the target group instances healthy or not. if it is healthy check in the browserr with the alb dns name.
now go to route53---> create a hosted zone with domain name you buy in godaddy ---> then u will see 4 name servers--- that name server update in godaddy site ---> now create a record set in route53 --> wait for some time bcoz it will have to recognize the 4 name servers with the godaddy site --> now check in browser with the record set name.
